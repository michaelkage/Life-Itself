"""Simulation core for the Simulated Reality Engine.

Seven sub-engines, pure Python, no engine dependency:

    decay      -- exponential memory decay with correct sign handling
    gossip     -- rumour mutation through social contact
    ecosystem  -- desperation index and behavioural status flips
    districts  -- macro dynamics over time, city scars with hysteresis
    trauma     -- personal stress accumulation and behavioural tiers
    justice    -- evidence, charges, plea bargaining
    fixers     -- reputation, willingness, betrayal

Engine-independent on purpose. This is the layer that runs on the background
thread behind Unreal's render loop; nothing in it may touch a UObject, a UWorld,
or a game thread. Keeping that boundary honest is what makes it testable now and
portable to C++ later.
